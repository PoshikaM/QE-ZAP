# Week 3 Progress Summary
### 🗓️ Day 13 – Introduction to Performance Testing with K6

- Set up K6 for the first time.

- Created a basic load test targeting a sample API.

- Learned how to simulate virtual users and apply checks for status code, response body, and response time.

### 🗓️ Day 14 – Advanced Load Testing Scenarios

- Implemented advanced test scenarios using stages (ramp-up, steady, ramp-down).

- Simulated real-world traffic behavior and understood how load levels affect performance.

### 🗓️ Day 15 – Analyzing Performance Test Results

- Analyzed key metrics like average response time, percentiles (P90, P95), and request volume.

- Discovered that only 37% of requests met the response time goal (<500ms).

- Learned to interpret test results and identify areas for performance improvement.

### 🗓️ Day 16 – Introduction to OWASP ZAP

- Installed and configured OWASP ZAP.

- Performed a basic vulnerability scan on http://testphp.vulnweb.com.

- Identified common vulnerabilities such as missing headers, CSP issues, and potential XSS risks.

### 🗓️ Day 17 – Identifying and Simulating Fixes for Vulnerabilities

- Documented all findings from the ZAP scan in a file named ZAP-Findings.md.

- Provided simulated fixes for each vulnerability based on OWASP recommendations.

- Demonstrated understanding of secure development practices even without direct code access.

### 🗓️ Day 18 – Review and Assessment

- Took an assessment to validate knowledge from the week's learning.

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with performance testing tools (K6).

- Learned how to simulate real-world load using staged testing.

- Understood how to read and interpret performance metrics and percentiles.

- Gained exposure to web security scanning with OWASP ZAP.

- Learned how to identify and suggest fixes for common security vulnerabilities.

- Improved skills in documenting findings and proposing secure coding practices.

- Developed stronger analytical thinking in both performance and security domains.
